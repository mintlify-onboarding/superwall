title: "Cohorting in 3rd Party Tools"
---

To easily view Superwall cohorts in 3rd party tools, we recommend you set user attributes based on the experiments that users are included in.

Swift

`extension SuperwallService: SuperwallDelegate {
  func handleSuperwallEvent(withInfo eventInfo: SuperwallEventInfo) {
    if eventInfo.event.description == "trigger_fire" { 
      MyAnalyticsService.shared.setUserAttributes([
        "sw_experiment_\(eventInfo.event.params["experiment_id"])": true,
        "sw_variant_\(eventInfo.event.params["variant_id"])": true
      ])
    }
  }
}
`

Once you've set this up, you can easily ask for all users who have an attribute `sw_experiment_1234` and breakdown by both variants to see how users in a Superwall experiment behave in other areas of your app.
