title: "Custom Paywall Actions"
---

You can set the click behavior of any element on a paywall to be a custom paywall action. This allows you to tie any tap in your paywall to hard-coded application logic.

For example, adding a custom action called `help_center` to a button in your paywall gives you the opportunity to present a help center whenever that button is pressed. To set this up, implement `handleCustomPaywallAction(withName:)` in your `SuperwallDelegate`:

SwiftObjective-C

`extension SuperwallService: SuperwallDelegate {
  func handleCustomPaywallAction(withName name: String) {
    if name == "help_center" {
      HelpCenterManager.present()
    }
  }
}
`

`// Inside PaywallService.m

- (void)handleCustomPaywallActionWithName:(NSString *)name
{
    NSLog(@"Custom button: %@", name);
}
`

Note: remember to set `Superwall.shared.delegate`!
