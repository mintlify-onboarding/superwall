title: "Custom Paywall Actions"
description: "You can set the click behavior of any element on a paywall to be a custom paywall action. This allows you to tie any tap in your paywall to hard-coded application logic."
---


For example, adding a custom action called `help_center` to a button in your paywall gives you the opportunity to present a help center whenever that button is pressed. To set this up, implement `handleCustomPaywallAction(withName:)` in your `SuperwallDelegate`:

<CodeGroup>
```Swift Swift
extension SuperwallService: SuperwallDelegate {
  func handleCustomPaywallAction(withName name: String) {
    if name == "help_center" {
      HelpCenterManager.present()
    }
  }
}
```

```Swift Objective-C
// Inside PaywallService.m

- (void)handleCustomPaywallActionWithName:(NSString *)name
{
    NSLog(@"Custom button: %@", name);
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  remember to set `Superwall.shared.delegate`!
