The Superwall Dashboard is your control center. This is where you configure paywalls, setup triggers, view analytics and more. If you don’t already have an account, you can [sign up for free](http://superwall.com/sign-up).

When you log in for the first time or create a new app, you'll see an onboarding checklist titled **Getting Started**:

As you complete the steps to integrate Superwall these items will check off automatically. See our [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide for help.

### Paywalls

> 👍
> 
> Superwall builds everyone a free paywall by hand
> 
> Superwall has built hundreds of paywalls for clients and has a unique vantage point on the industry. As a token of gratitude for signing up, we create a paywall for each customer, using best practices we've picked up along the way. Check your email for updates :)

The [Paywalls](/docs/configuring-a-paywall) section of the dashboard is where you'll configure and manage all your paywalls. When you first log in, you'll see an **Example Paywall** built out for you. 

Here's what your Paywalls section might look like at scale.

 You can toggle its interface style to view analytics too.

### Campaigns

The [Campaigns](/docs/campaigns) section of the dashboard is where you configure _when_ and _who_ to show a paywall to, using triggers and rules. In the image below, Campaign 2 is triggered when the SDK fires either a `pressed_continue_welcome_screen` or `load_feed` event. Campaign 1's trigger is switched _off_, indicated by a cross through its icon and lack of background color. This means that the campaign won't be triggered for a `viewed_welcome_screen` event:

### Analytics

After integrating Superwall into your app, you'll notice useful analytics populate in realtime at the top of the dashboard. You can use the top right dropdown to toggle between data for **New Installs**  and **All Users**, as well as refine the date range.

Clicking a metric redirects to the Charts page where you can break down a chart for a given time range and granularity:

Below the high level metrics on the dashboard, you can see breakdowns per campaign/trigger/rule/paywall for the selected date range:

### Settings

Clicking the **cog icon** in the corner will bring up a list of actions that allow you to retrieve your Public API Key, manage your account, integrate RevenueCat, manage billing, and more.
