You can localize paywalls for specific locales. The SDK will select the appropriate paywall locale based on the device's locale settings. If the chosen locale is not available, the English version will be displayed.

Select a paywall from the dashboard and click on **EN** to show the locale dropdown. Then click on **Edit localizations ->**:

Click **Download Template** to download the strings file for all of your paywalls:

This file follows a `"original text" = "translated text"` format for each of your paywall text elements. You should translate all the strings in the file into your desired language. [Variables](/docs/interactive-paywall-preview#adding-variables) inside text fields will be replaced with `{}` in the original text.

> English-language variables such as `{ primary.trialPeriodText }` cannot be localized as these are substituted by the SDK in English only. If you want to localize these, you'll need to hardcode them into the paywall with text, e.g. "3-day", so that their text can be picked up and substituted by the localization template.

Once youâ€™ve completed translation, click **Add Language**:

You can also preview it on device using the [In-App Previews](/docs/in-app-paywall-previews).
