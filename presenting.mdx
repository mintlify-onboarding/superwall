title: "Retrieving and Presenting a Paywall Yourself"
description: "If you want complete control over the paywall presentation process, you can use `getPaywall(forEvent:params:paywallOverrides:delegate:)`. This returns the `UIViewController` subclass `PaywallViewController`, which you can then present however you like. The following is code is how you'd mimic [register](/docs/feature-gating):"
---

```Swift Swift
final class MyViewController: UIViewController {
  private func presentPaywall() async {
    do {
      // 1
  	  let paywallVc = try await Superwall.shared.getPaywall(
        forEvent: "campaign_trigger",
        delegate: self
      )
   	  self.present(paywallVc, animated: true)
    } catch let skippedReason as PaywallSkippedReason {
      // 2
      switch skippedReason {
       case .holdout,
       .noRuleMatch,
       .eventNotFound,
       .userIsSubscribed:
         break
       }
    } catch {
      // 3
      print(error)
    }
  }

  private func launchFeature() {
    // Insert code to launch a feature that's behind your paywall.
  }
}

// 4
extension MyViewController: PaywallViewControllerDelegate {
  func paywall(
    _ paywall: PaywallViewController,
    didFinishWith result: PaywallResult,
    shouldDismiss: Bool
  ) {
    if shouldDismiss {
      paywall.dismiss(animated: true)
    }

    switch result {
    case .purchased,
      .restored:
      launchFeature()
    case .declined:
      let closeReason = paywall.info.closeReason
      let featureGating = paywall.info.featureGatingBehavior
      if closeReason != .forNextPaywall && featureGating == .nonGated {
        launchFeature()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```Swift Objective-C
@interface MyViewController : UIViewController

- (void)presentPaywall;

@end

@interface MyViewController () <SWKPaywallViewControllerDelegate>

@end

@implementation MyViewController

- (void)presentPaywall {
  // 1
  [[Superwall sharedInstance] getPaywallForEvent:@"campaign_trigger" params:nil paywallOverrides:nil delegate:self completion:^(SWKGetPaywallResult * _Nonnull result) {
    if (result.paywall != nil) {
      [self presentViewController:result.paywall animated:YES completion:nil];
    } else if (result.skippedReason != SWKPaywallSkippedReasonNone) {
      switch (result.skippedReason) {
      // 2
        case SWKPaywallSkippedReasonHoldout:
        case SWKPaywallSkippedReasonUserIsSubscribed:
        case SWKPaywallSkippedReasonEventNotFound:
        case SWKPaywallSkippedReasonNoRuleMatch:
        case SWKPaywallSkippedReasonNone:
          break;
      };
    } else if (result.error) {
      // 3
      NSLog(@"%@", result.error);
    }
  }];
}

-(void)launchFeature {
  // Insert code to launch a feature that's behind your paywall.
}

// 4
- (void)paywall:(SWKPaywallViewController *)paywall didFinishWithResult:(enum SWKPaywallResult)result shouldDismiss:(BOOL)shouldDismiss {
  if (shouldDismiss) {
    [paywall dismissViewControllerAnimated:true completion:nil];
  }

  SWKPaywallCloseReason closeReason;
  SWKFeatureGatingBehavior featureGating;

  switch (result) {
  case SWKPaywallResultPurchased:
  case SWKPaywallResultRestored:
    [self launchFeature];
    break;
  case SWKPaywallResultDeclined:
    closeReason = paywall.info.closeReason;
    featureGating = paywall.info.featureGatingBehavior;

    if (closeReason != SWKPaywallCloseReasonForNextPaywall && featureGating == SWKFeatureGatingBehaviorNonGated) {
        [self launchFeature];
    }
    break;
  }
}

@end
```

This does the following:

1. Gets the paywall view controller.
2. Handles the cases where the paywall was skipped.
3. Catches any presentation errors.
4. Implements the delegate. This is called when the user is finished with the paywall. First, it checks `shouldDismiss`. If this is true then is dismissed the paywall from view before launching any features. This may depend on the `result` depending on how you first presented your view. Then, it switches over the `result`. If the result is `purchased` or `restored` the feature can be launched. However, if the result is `declined`, it checks that the the `featureGating` property of `paywall.info` is `nonGated` and that the `closeReason` isn't `.forNextPaywall`.

### Best practices

1. **Make sure to prevent a paywall from being accessed after a purchase has occurred**.

If a user purchases from a paywall, it is your responsibility to make sure that the user can't access that paywall again. For example, if after successful purchase you decide to push a new view on to the navigation stack, you should make sure that the user can't go back to access the paywall.

2. **Make sure the paywall view controller deallocates before presenting it elsewhere**.

If you have a paywall view controller presented somewhere and you try to present the same view controller elsewhere, you will get a crash. For example, you may have a paywall in a tab bar controller, and then you also try to present it modally. We plan on improving this, but currently it's your responsibility to ensure this doesn't happen.
