Visit [Superwall Events](/docs/tracking-analytics) to see a full list of parameters that you can use with these events.

### `paywall_decline`

This is registered when a user manually dismisses any paywall.

You can combine this with rules to show a paywall when a user closes a specific paywall:

<Frame>![](/images/caa0f2c-Screenshot_2023-08-21_at_16.07.15.png) </Frame>

Here, when a user closes the paywall named `Example Paywall | Non Gated`, a new paywall will show.

Note that you can't reference parameters that you've passed in to your original register call in your rules for `paywall_decline`.

### `survey_response`

This is registered when a response to a paywall survey as been recorded. First, you need to make sure your paywall [has a survey attached](/docs/surveys).

You can combine this with rules to show a paywall whenever a survey response is recorded or when the user gives a specific response:

<Frame>![](/images/ba49517-Screenshot_2023-08-21_at_16.42.02.png) </Frame>

Here if the user selects an option named `Too Expensive`, they will see another paywall. This is a great opportunity to show a discounted paywall to improve your conversion rate.

### `deepLink_open`

This is registered when a user opens the app via a deep link. First, you need to make sure to [tell Superwall when a deep link has been opened](/docs/in-app-paywall-previews).

You can use the URL parameters of the deep link within your rules:

<Frame>![](/images/fd13248-Screenshot_2023-08-22_at_11.53.33.png) </Frame>

This rule will match the deep link `myapp://paywall?offer=July20`.
