### Logging

Logging is enabled by default in the SDK and is controlled by two properties: `level` and `scopes`.

`level` determines the minimum log level to print to the console. There are five types of log level:

1. **debug**: Prints all logs from the SDK to the console. Useful for debugging your app if something isn't working as expected.
2. **info**: Prints errors, warnings, and useful information from the SDK to the console.
3. **warn**: Prints errors and warnings from the SDK to the console.
4. **error**: Only prints errors from the SDK to the console.
5. **none**: Turns off all logs.

The SDK defaults to `info`.

`scopes` defines the scope of logs to print to the console. For example, you might only care about logs relating to `paywallPresentation` and `paywallTransactions`. This defaults to `.all`. Check out [LogScope](https://sdk.superwall.me/documentation/superwallkit/logscope) for all possible cases.

You set these properties like this:

SwiftObjective-C

```swift SwiftObjective-C
let options = SuperwallOptions()
options.logging.level = .warn
options.scopes = [.paywallPresentation, paywallTransactions]

Superwall.configure(apiKey:"MY_API_KEY", options: options);

// Or you can set:
Superwall.shared.logLevel = .warn
```

```swift
[[Superwall sharedInstance] setLogLevel:SWKLogLevelWarn];
```

### Preloading Paywalls

Paywalls are preloaded by default when the app is launched from a cold start. The paywalls that are preloaded are determined by the list of events that result in a paywall for the user when [registered](/docs/feature-gating). Note that this is regardless of whether they match a rule at the point of preloading.

Paywalls are cached by default, which means after they load once, they don't need to be reloaded from the network unless you make a change to them on the dashboard. However, if you have a lot of paywalls, preloading may increase network usage of your app on first load of the paywalls and result in slower loading times overall.

You can turn off preloading by setting `shouldPreload` to `false`:

```swift SwiftObjective-C
let options = SuperwallOptions()
options.paywalls.shouldPreload = false

Superwall.configure(apiKey: "MY_API_KEY", options: options)
```

```swift 
SWKSuperwallOptions *options = [[SWKSuperwallOptions alloc] init];
options.paywalls.shouldPreload = false;

[Superwall configureWithApiKey:@"MY_API_KEY" purchaseController:nil options:options completion:^{}];
```

Then, if you'd like to preload paywalls for specific event names you can use `preloadPaywalls(forEvents:)`:

```swift SwiftObjective-C
Superwall.shared.preloadPaywalls(forEvents: ["campaign_trigger"]);
```

```swift
NSMutableSet<NSString *> *eventNames = [NSMutableSet set];
[eventNames addObject:@"campaign_trigger"];

[[Superwall sharedInstance] preloadPaywallsForEvents:eventNames];
```

If you'd like to preload all paywalls you can use `preloadAllPaywalls()`:

```swift SwiftObjective-C
Superwall.shared.preloadAllPaywalls()
```

```swift 
[[Superwall sharedInstance] preloadAllPaywalls];
```

Note: These methods will not reload any paywalls that have already been preloaded.

### External Data Collection

By default, Superwall sends all registered events and properties back to the Superwall servers. However, if you have privacy concerns, you can stop this by setting `isExternalDataCollectionEnabled` to `false`:

```swift SwiftObjective-C
let options = SuperwallOptions()
options.isExternalDataCollectionEnabled = false

Superwall.configure(apiKey: "MY_API_KEY", options: options)
```

```swift
SWKSuperwallOptions *options = [[SWKSuperwallOptions alloc] init];
options.isExternalDataCollectionEnabled = false;

[Superwall configureWithApiKey:@"MY_API_KEY" purchaseController:nil options:options completion:^{}];
```

Disabling this will not affect your ability to create triggers based on properties.

### Automatically Dismissing the Paywall

By default, Superwall automatically dismisses the paywall when a product is purchased or restored. You can disable this by setting `automaticallyDismiss` to `false`:

```swift SwiftObjective-C
let options = SuperwallOptions()
options.paywalls.automaticallyDismiss = false

Superwall.configure(apiKey: "MY_API_KEY", options: options)
```

```swift 
SWKSuperwallOptions *options = [[SWKSuperwallOptions alloc] init];
options.automaticallyDismiss = false;

[Superwall configureWithApiKey:@"MY_API_KEY" purchaseController:nil options:options completion:^{}];
```

To manually dismiss the paywall , call `Superwall.shared.dismiss()`.

### Custom Restore Failure Message

You can set the title, message and close button title for the alert that appears after a restoration failure:

``` swift SwiftObjective-C
let options = SuperwallOptions()
options.paywalls.restoreFailed.title = "My Title"
options.paywalls.restoreFailed.message = "My message"
options.paywalls.restoreFailed.closeButtonTitle = "Close"

Superwall.configure(apiKey: "MY_API_KEY", options: options)
```

```swift
SWKSuperwallOptions *options = [[SWKSuperwallOptions alloc] init];
options.paywalls.restoreFailed.title = @"My Title";
options.paywalls.restoreFailed.message = @"My message";
options.paywalls.restoreFailed.closeButtonTitle = @"Close";

[Superwall configureWithApiKey:@"MY_API_KEY" purchaseController:nil options:options completion:^{}];
```

### Haptic Feedback

By default, the paywall uses haptic feedback after a user purchases or restores a product, opens a URL from the paywall, or closes the paywall. To disable this, set the `isHapticFeedbackEnabled` `PaywallOption` to false:

```swift SwiftObjective-C
let options = SuperwallOptions()
options.paywalls.isHapticFeedbackEnabled = false

Superwall.configure(apiKey: "MY_API_KEY", options: options)
```

```swift
SWKSuperwallOptions *options = [[SWKSuperwallOptions alloc] init];
options.isHapticFeedbackEnabled = false;

[Superwall configureWithApiKey:@"MY_API_KEY" purchaseController:nil options:options completion:^{}];
```

### Transaction Background View

During a transaction, we add a `UIActivityIndicator` behind the view to indicate a loading status. However, you can remove this by setting the `transactionBackgroundView` to `nil`:

```swift Swift
let options = SuperwallOptions()
options.paywalls.transactionBackgroundView = nil

Superwall.configure(apiKey: "MY_API_KEY", options: options)
```

### Purchase Failure Alert

When a purchase fails, we automatically present an alert with the error message. If you'd like to show your own alert after failure, set the `shouldShowPurchaseFailureAlert` `PaywallOption` to `false`:

```swift Swift
let options = SuperwallOptions()
options.paywalls.shouldShowPurchaseFailureAlert = false

Superwall.configure(apiKey: "MY_API_KEY", options: options)
```

### Locale Identifier

When evaluating rules, the device locale identifier is set to `autoupdatingCurrent`. However, you can override this if you want to test a specific locale:

<CodeGroup>

```swift Swift
let options = SuperwallOptions()
options.localeIdentifier = "en_GB"

Superwall.configure(apiKey: "MY_API_KEY", options: options)
```

```swift Objective-C
SWKSuperwallOptions *options = [[SWKSuperwallOptions alloc] init];
options.localeIdentifier = @"en_GB";

[Superwall configureWithApiKey:@"MY_API_KEY" purchaseController:nil options:options completion:^{}];
```

</CodeGroup>

For a list of locales that are available on iOS, take a look at [this list](https://gist.github.com/jacobbubu/1836273). You can also preview your paywall in different locales using [In-App Previews](/docs/in-app-paywall-previews).

### Game Controller

If you're using a game controller, you can enable this in `SuperwallOptions` too. Check out our [Game Controller Support](/docs/game-controller-support) article.

Take a look at [SuperwallOptions](https://sdk.superwall.me/documentation/superwallkit/superwalloptions) in our SDK reference for more info.
