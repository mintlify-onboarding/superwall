If you haven't already, [sign up for a free account](https://superwall.com/sign-up) on Superwall. Then, when you're through to the Dashboard, click **Settings** from the panel on the left, click **Keys** and copy your **Public API Key**:

Then, open **AppDelegate.swift** and call `Superwall.configure(apiKey:)` inside `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions)` with your API key. If you're using SwiftUI, you can call this on the `init` of your main `App` file:


<CodeGroup>

```swift Swift-UIKit
import UIKit
import SuperwallKit

@main
final class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
  func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
  ) -> Bool {
    Superwall.configure(apiKey: "MY_API_KEY") // Replace this with your API Key
    return true
  }
}
```

```swift SwiftUI
import SwiftUI
import SuperwallKit

@main
struct MyApp: App {
  init() {
    let apiKey = "MY_API_KEY" // Replace this with your API Key
    Superwall.configure(apiKey: apiKey)
  }
  
  // etc...
}
```

```swift Objective-C
@import SuperwallKit;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    // Initialize the Superwall service.
    [Superwall configureWithApiKey:@"MY_API_KEY"];
    return YES;
}
```

</CodeGroup>

This configures a shared instance of `Superwall`, the primary class for interacting with the SDK's API. Make sure to replace `MYAPIKEY` with your public API key that you just retrieved.

<Note>
  By default, Superwall handles basic subscription-related logic for you. However, if you’d like greater control over this process (e.g. if you’re using RevenueCat), you’ll want to pass in a `PurchaseController` to your configuration call and manually set the `subscriptionStatus`. You can also pass in `SuperwallOptions` to customize the appearance and behavior of the SDK. See [Purchases and Subscription Status](/docs/advanced-configuration) for more.
</Note>

You've now configured Superwall!
